# Disaster day

## A simulated incident response exercise

---

# What is Disaster Day?

- A simulated incident response excercise, similar to a fire drill or wheel of misfortune
- The facilitator introduces the team to the excercise and triggers an incident
- The team responds to the incident: triage, mitigate, find the root cause
- After the incident has been mitigated, the team collectively writes a post-mortem to analyze the incident and gather learnings and follow-up action items
- Designed for teams that are at a beginner or intermediate level of maturity in infrastructure operations / incident response.
- Can be run as a stand-alone exercise as part of a project

# Why conduct a Disaster Day?

- The incident response exercise demonstrates the value and gaps in alerting, tracing, metrics and other observability tools, playbooks and pre-defined incident response processes, even to non-technical stakeholders.
- The incident response validates the teams understanding of the software and the environment as well as incident response processes and documentation.
- Incident response may also provide new insights into how the application runs in the environment, for example by revealing hidden dependencies.
- A simulated incident teaches real incident response skills in a safe environment.
- Teambuilding: an incident response exercise helps bring the team together.

# When to conduct a Disaster Day

- To conduct a disaster day, you need
  - A shared environment that you care about (for example a development environment)
  - A team of willing engineers to participate in the exercise. If working with a large team (8+ participants), consider establishing coordinator and timeline-keeper roles beforehand.
  - A facilitator for the excercise
  - An OK to break the environment
- A single exercise usually requires 2-4h, including writing the post-mortem. At least half a day should be reserved for the disaster day.
- Disaster day can be run on-site or virtually. On-site is preferred, but virtual works too
